## [1.0.5] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Home tab**: the former "Sessions" tab is renamed to "Home", always stays first, and can no
  longer be reordered past — no other tab can be dragged before it.
- **Session tab renaming**: right-click a session tab → "Rename Tab..." to give it a custom title.
- **Activity feedback**: background tab activity now blinks the tab title in bold blue (settling
  to solid bold blue once traffic stops) instead of a small dot icon; the tab title is pre-padded
  so it no longer grows/shrinks when the font toggles bold. Disconnected sessions show a fixed
  bold red title, including while selected.
- **Close confirmation**: clicking the close (×) button on a session tab now asks for confirmation
  before disconnecting/closing it.
- **Per-session terminal type**: editable combo (`xterm-256color`, `xterm`, `vt100`, `ansi`,
  `linux`) sent as the PTY type — useful for AIX servers, which expect a plain `xterm`.
- **Per-session Backspace key**: choose `DEL (0x7F)` (default) or `BS (0x08)` — AIX servers use a
  different Backspace code than Linux.
- **Update check**: on startup, the app silently checks GitHub for a newer release; if found, a
  "New version available — Download" link appears on the Home tab.
- **About dialog**: now shows the real running version/build/date (previously hardcoded
  "Version 1.0.0"), credits third-party libraries (Eclipse SWT, JSch — mwiede fork) with clickable
  links, and includes the project copyright line.
- The build version label on the Home tab is now a clickable link to that release's GitHub page.

### Fixed
- The tree-view expand/collapse triangle for session groups was nearly invisible on the dark
  background (Windows Explorer theme assumes a light background); it now uses the classic +/- box.
- Removed a leftover internal hostname reference from the terminal appearance preview text.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- Windows installer now detects a previously installed version and offers to uninstall it before
  installing the new one (WiX `UpgradeCode` / `--win-upgrade-uuid`).
- Automatic Windows code-signing via GitHub Actions: when the `CODE_SIGN_CERT_BASE64` and
  `CODE_SIGN_PASSWORD` repository secrets are present the installer is signed with `signtool.exe`
  using SHA-256 and a Sectigo RFC 3161 timestamp.
- `SIGNING.md` — instructions for configuring a PFX certificate or applying for a free
  [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.io/code-signing-for-open-source/) certificate.
- README: "Code signing" section mentioning SignPath Foundation.

### Fixed
- `run.bat`: JAR path resolved by glob **after** `mvn clean package` — the previous version
  resolved the glob before the build, so a clean workspace reported "Unable to access jarfile".

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow: version is now derived dynamically from the git tag and Maven POM
  (`mvn help:evaluate`) — no more hardcoded version string in the jpackage command.

### Fixed
- Second security audit — four additional issues resolved:
  - `StrictHostKeyChecking` changed from `"no"` to `"ask"`; unknown host fingerprints now show
    a confirmation dialog instead of being accepted silently.
  - Path-traversal check added to `TerminalTab.openLogFile`: the configured log directory is
    validated to be under `user.home` before any file is created.
  - `SecureFiles` utility: all application files and directories now created with owner-only
    permissions (`rw-------` / `rwx------` on POSIX; Windows equivalent via `setReadable/Writable`).
  - `CredentialStore.deriveKey`: `PBEKeySpec.clearPassword()` is now called in a `finally` block
    so the password char array is zeroed even when key derivation throws.
- Version numbers in `BuildInfo.java` and `pom.xml` were out of sync with the GitHub release tag;
  all three are now kept aligned.
- `run.bat`: JAR filename detected by glob (`14bis-ssh-*.jar`) instead of a hardcoded version
  string — the script no longer breaks after a version bump.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- First security audit — three critical and one high-severity issue resolved:
  - **Critical — password stored as `String`**: `CredentialEntry.password` changed from `String`
    to `char[]`; passwords are zeroed with `Arrays.fill` as soon as they are no longer needed.
    `SWT Text.getTextChars()` is used everywhere to avoid creating temporary `String` objects.
  - **Critical — SSH password passed as `String`**: `SshConnection.connect` now accepts
    `char[]`; the password is encoded to a UTF-8 `byte[]` via `CharBuffer`, passed to JSch,
    and the byte array is zeroed immediately after use.
  - **Critical — vault serialization created `String` from password**: `CredentialStore` now
    serializes passwords character-by-character with `escChars(char[], StringBuilder)`, avoiding
    any `String` representation.
  - **High — application files world-readable**: log, session, vault, and settings files are now
    created with `SecureFiles` (owner-only permissions; atomic write via temp-file + `ATOMIC_MOVE`).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-27

_No code changes — tag created to mark the first publicly announced release._

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **App icon** in native installers: `IconExporter` renders the application icon using AWT at
  multiple sizes (16, 32, 48, 128, 256 px) during the Maven `prepare-package` phase.
  GitHub Actions converts the PNG to ICO (Windows) and ICNS (macOS) before calling jpackage.
- Sessions tab no longer has a close button; terminal tabs keep their individual close (×) button.
- GitHub Actions release workflow builds native installers for Windows (`.exe`), Linux (`.deb`),
  and macOS (`.dmg`) in parallel with `fail-fast: false`.
- Linux package renamed to `ssh-14bis` (jpackage DEB validator requires names that start with a
  letter, not a digit).

### Changed
- Session groups can be organised in the sessions panel.
- Terminal appearance (font, foreground colour, background colour) is configurable per session.
